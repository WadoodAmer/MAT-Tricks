# MAT-Tricks

This repository hosts "MAT-Tricks-The Matrix Calculator". It was my 1st semester project for CS-101 course. It is written in C++ Language.
## Synopsis

MAT-Tricks is a Console Base matrix calculator & analyzer. Given a 2D-matrix of arbitrary order. i.e (N x M). It can analyze and transform it according to the concepts of linear equations. i.e Linear Algebra.

## Motivation

The idea of this project was drived from concepts of Linear Algebra. As many engineering and computer science students study linear algebra course in their degree program. So, this can prove to be a very helpful tool for the students, teachers as well as bussiness analysist.

## Usage

The Student solve questions based on their learnings of linear algebra concepts. This project can prove to be very helpful tool to cross check their calculations. Moreover, teachers can use this tool to check assignments and check assignments and design course effectively. Bussiness identities can also use it to calculate the system of linear equation they come across during bussiness analysis.

## Features

MAT-Tricks mainly provides the following features.

1) Calculate Reduce Echlon form of a matrix

3) Apply Transformation on a Vector

4) Calculate Multiplication of a matrices

5) Calculate Arithmatic operation on matrices

6) Do analysis of the matrix.

## How To RUN

Step 1: Simply download the following files:

      i)  MAT-Tricks ITC-PROJECT.h

      ii) MAT-Tricks ITC-PROJECT.cpp

Step 2: Create an empty c++ project in any c++ compiler. e.g MS-Visual Studio 2010/13 etc.

Step 3: Add downloaded files to the project.

Step 4: Compile and RUN the project.

## License

The Project is not under any license policy. However, it is recommended that the code is used only for study perposes or personal use. It is not intended to be commercialized in any sense. Also, do not plegderize the code for submitting acedemically in any institues.
